/* Challenge

Write a code that initializes three variables, a, b and c with the values 9, 2.6, and 11 (respectively).

After that, initialize the following variables:

d that will hold the result of a modulo 2 
e that will hold the result of a modulo 3
f that will hold the result of c modulo 10
Check out the result and see how different dividends and divisors affect the result. */

// Type your code below
let a = 9;
let b = 2.6;
let c = 11;
let d = a % 2;
let e = a % 3;
let f = c % 10;

// Don't change the line below
console.log(`a = ${a}`);
console.log(`b = ${b}`);
console.log(`c = ${c}`);
console.log(`d = ${d}`);
console.log(`e = ${e}`);
console.log(`f = ${f}`);
