/* Challenge

You are given a code with three variables: a, b, and c.

Your task is to perform the following comparisons and print the results:

Check if a is loosely equal to b and store the result in d.
Check if a is strictly equal to c and store the result in e.
Check if b is loosely not equal to c and store the result in f.
Check if a is strictly not equal to b and store the result in g.
Use the given variables and comparison operators to complete the task. */

// Given variables
let a = 10;
let b = '10';
let c = true;
let d = a == b;
let e = a === c;
let f = b != c;
let g = a !== b;

// Type your code below

// Don't change the line below
console.log(`d = ${d}`);
console.log(`e = ${e}`);
console.log(`f = ${f}`);
console.log(`g = ${g}`);
