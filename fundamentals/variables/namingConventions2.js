The following code contains variable declarations, but not all of them follow proper JavaScript naming conventions. Your task is to identify and remove the variables that do not follow naming conventions. Proper naming conventions include:

Variable names should be written in camelCase.
Avoid using reserved keywords or starting with a number.
Variable names should be descriptive and avoid unnecessary characters.
No spaces or special characters (except _ and $ if needed). */

let userName = 'John';
let $totalSales = 1000;
let productID = 12345;
let itemPrice$ = 25.99;
let _isLoggedIn = true;
