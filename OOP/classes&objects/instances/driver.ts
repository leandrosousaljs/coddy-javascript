/* Challenge

You're given a Student class. Your task is to create two student instances in the driver.js file:

Create student1 with name "Sarah" and grade 85
Create student2 with name "Mike" and grade 92 */

import { Student } from './student.ts';

// TODO: Create an instance of class Student called student1 with name "Sarah" and grade 85
const student1 = new Student('Sarah', 85);

// TODO: Create an instance of class Student called student2 with name "Mike" and grade 92
const student2 = new Student('Mike', 92);

// Test code - don't modify
console.log(student1.name); // Should output "Sarah"
console.log(student2.grade); // Should output 92
