/* Challenge

Create three variables using TypeScript's type inference without explicit type annotations:

Declare a variable named companyName and initialize it with the string "TechCorp".

Declare a variable named employeeCount and initialize it with the number 150.

Declare a variable named isPublic and initialize it with the boolean value false.

Print all three variables to the console on separate lines in the order they were declared.

TypeScript will automatically infer the correct types based on the initial values you assign to each variable. */

// TODO: Write your code here
// Declare the three variables with their initial values
// Remember to use TypeScript's type inference (no explicit type annotations needed)
let companyName = 'TechCorp';
let employeeCount = 150;
let isPublic = false;

// Print all three variables to the console
console.log(companyName);
console.log(employeeCount);
console.log(isPublic);
