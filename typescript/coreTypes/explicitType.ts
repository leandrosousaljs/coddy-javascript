/* Challenge

Declare a variable named totalScore with the explicit type number without assigning it an initial value.

On the next line, assign the value 95 to the totalScore variable.

Then declare another variable named playerName with the explicit type string without assigning it an initial value.

On the next line, assign the value "Alex" to the playerName variable.

Finally, print both variables to the console on separate lines, first totalScore then playerName. */

// TODO: Write your code here

let totalScore: number;

totalScore = 95;
playerName = 'Alex';

console.log(totalScore);
