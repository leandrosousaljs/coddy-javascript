/* Challenge

Create a typed array named scores that can only hold numbers and initialize it with the values 85, 92, and 78.

Then create another typed array named studentNames that can only hold strings and initialize it with the values "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie".

Finally, create a typed array named passedExams that can only hold boolean values and initialize it with true, false, and true.

Print all three arrays to the console on separate lines in the order they were created. */

let passedExams: boolean[] = [true, false, true];

console.log(score);
