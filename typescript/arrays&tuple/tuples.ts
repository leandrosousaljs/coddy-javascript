/* Challenge

Create a tuple named productInfo that holds a string (product name) followed by a number (price). Initialize it with the product name "Gaming Mouse" and the price 79.

Then create another tuple named coordinates that holds two numbers representing x and y positions. Initialize it with the values 15 and 25.

Access and print the product name from the productInfo tuple.

Access and print the price from the productInfo tuple.

Access and print the x coordinate from the coordinates tuple.

Access and print the y coordinate from the coordinates tuple.

Print each value on a separate line in the order specified above. */

// TODO: Write your code here
// Create the productInfo tuple with product name and price
// Create the coordinates tuple with x and y positions
// Access and print each value as specified

let productInfo: [string, number] = ['Gaming Mouse', 79];
let coordinates: [number, number] = [15, 25];

console.log(productInfo[0]);
console.log(productInfo[1]);
console.log(coordinates[0]);
console.log(coordinates[1]);
